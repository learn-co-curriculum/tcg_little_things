## Video

Watch Sandi Metz's [All the Little Things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bZh5LMaSmE) talk about testing, refactoring, and object oriented design patterns.

- What are the names of the design patterns mentioned in the talk?
- What are the key things you took away from watching the talk?

Go back and look at your Gilded Rose solution. Are there any tests that you'd like to add? Is there any further refactoring that you'd like to do? Take some time to add the additional tests, and then take the time to refactor your code.

In the talk, Sandi Metz mentions the 'Principles of Object Oriented Design'. What are those principles? How do they apply to your Gilded Rose code?
